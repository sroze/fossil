FROM foundationdb/foundationdb:7.1.22
RUN sed -i '$ s/$/ --knob_disable_posix_kernel_aio=1/' /var/fdb/scripts/fdb.bash

# Anyway, this does not seem to work:
# ```
# [root@d5ca3785b298 /]# fdbcli
# ERROR: Disk i/o operation failed (1510)

# Same on M2: https://forums.foundationdb.org/t/foundationdb-on-docker-mac-m2/3876

# Another option, using 7.1.27 (https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/7.1.27)
# does start the container, but quickly grows in memory and get "killed".
# ```
# [root@655a38bd2a7a /]# fdbserver
# Killed

# Next... try to run it on Mac directly ðŸ˜¢
